problem 1

if the number is even and less than 15, print a
if the number is even and more than 15, print b
if the number is odd and less than 10, print c
if the number is odd and more than 10, print d

We need to solve this using two methods
using nested if else
using logical operators


problem 2
Result
answer should be: "Hi, my name is Farheena"
we need to solve this using for loop

problem 3

global scope and local scope


problem 4

create a variable called myName and store your name inside it.
then, add Mr./Miss. before it and store the result in
a new variable with the same name i.e. myName.

problem 5

Find sum and multiplication of  all natural numbers from 10 to 20



problem 6

Check whether a given year is a leap year
 
create a variable and store a random year in it 
now write code, which should return  true or false, depending whether the value in the above variable is leap year or not


problem 7

find the area of a triangle.  Lengths of its sides are 5, 6, 7


problem 8

create two variables and store numbers in them.
Now, write code, which return true if one of the variable is 50 or if their sum is 50.
Otherwise, you need to return false.
Also handle edge cases
(in real world, these two numbers will be supplied by the users.
Now think what if they supply something which is not a number ?)


problem 9

create a variable and store a number inside it
write program to check whether a given variable is between 100 and 200
write program to check whether a given variable is between 100 and 200 or 400 and 500
handle edge cases


problem 10

you have 3 numbers.
write a program which can find the largest number


problem 11

create two variables and assign numbers to them
now write a code which returns true if one of them is 8 or their sum or difference is 8. Otherwise it should return false
