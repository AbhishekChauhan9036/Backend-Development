/*JavaScript (JS) :-is the worldâ€™s most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language. 
It is also known as a scripting language for web pages. It can be used for Client-side as well as 
Server-side developments.*/


/*Datatypes in JavaScript:-There are majorly two types of languages. First, one is Statically typed 
language where each variable and expression type is already known at compile time. Once a variable is
declared to be of a certain data type, it cannot hold values of other data types.
Example: C, C++, Java. 
Other, Dynamically typed languages: These languages can receive different data types over time. 
For example- Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc.

Premitive- Numbers,String,Boolean,Null,Undefined,Symbol,bigint
Non Premitive- Array,Object
